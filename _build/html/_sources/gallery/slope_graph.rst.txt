    :code-below:

    
    import altair as alt
    from vega_datasets import data

    source = data.barley()

    # The year here is stored by pandas as an integer. When treating columns as dates,
    # it is best to use either a string representation or a datetime representation.
    source.year = source.year.astype(str)

    alt.Chart(source).mark_line().encode(
        x='year',
        y='median(yield)',
